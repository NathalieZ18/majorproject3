    <font size="4">
    <center>Pop art was an art movement that emerged in the late 1950s and early 1960s that was inspired by commercial and popular culture. Pop art was defined as a diverse response to the postwar era's commodity-driven values, often using commonplace objects as subject matter or as part of the work, despite the lack of a specific style or attitude. </center></p>

    <font size="4">
    <center>Pop art peaked in the 1960s after emerging in the mid 1950s in the United Kingdom and the late 1950s in the United States. It began as a reaction to dominant approaches to art and culture, as well as traditional ideas about what art should be. Young artists felt that what they were taught in art school and what they saw in museums had nothing to do with their lives or what they saw every day. Instead, they drew inspiration from sources such as Hollywood films, advertising, product packaging, pop music, and comic books. It coincided with the globalization of pop music and youth culture, as exemplified by Elvis Presley and The Beatles.</center></p>

    <center>Pop Art was brash, young, and fun, as well as hostile to the artistic establishment. It featured various styles of painting and sculpture from various countries, but what they all had in common was an interest in mass-media, mass-production, and mass-culture. It is widely regarded as both a reaction to and an expansion on the then-dominant ideas of abstract expressionism. It is also similar to Dada in that it makes use of found objects and images. Pop Art aimed to use images of popular culture rather than elitist culture in its art. Pop Art aimed to use images of popular culture in art rather than elitist culture, emphasizing the banal or kitschy elements of any given culture, most often through the use of irony. It is also linked to the use of mechanical reproduction or rendering techniques by artists.</center>

    <center>In what ways can pop art be considered a social movement in addition to an artistic movement? In the sense that it has had an impact on people's lives outside of the art world. Pop art was the first to declare that advertising and commercial endeavors were in fact forms of art. Pop art subsumes trends and fashions into an all-encompassing phenomenon that seeks to merge the entire cultural endeavor into a single aesthetic style. If art were a form of advertising, all art would be attempting to promote or represent something; however, this is not the function of art. Art does not have to represent anything or serve any purpose. Pop Art altered people's perceptions of art and laid the groundwork for a new art revolution in which artists let their ideas become reality without regard for any art rules they were taught to follow. Pop Art drew people's attention and eyes with high contrasts and posters. Pop Art is defined by bold, bright collages and colors that are in your face.</center></p>

<p>
    <font size="4">
    <center>Even now, nearly 60 years after the movement's inception, we continue to celebrate pop art. It has undoubtedly left an imprint on contemporary artworks, design, and, of course, advertising. Pop art dresses continue to inspire contemporary designers in fashion, as does pop art furniture, which uses a similar palette of bright colors, plastic, and rigid shapes. Furthermore, we continue to see regular homages, tributes, and exhibits of original pop art works around the world, particularly at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA), one of New York's finest museums, and the ICA. They are practically pop art shrines, housing hundreds of pieces that fall under the banner of pop art.</center>

    <center>Pop art is now being used to enhance other forms of art, from the artwork of music duo Major Lazer, complete with bold colors and thick-ink edges, to Shepard Fairey's Hope poster featuring former President Barack Obama.</center></p>
